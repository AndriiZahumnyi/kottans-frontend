My reflections on all Linux CLI, and HTTP subtasks.

Linux CLI module_1, module_2 weren`t new for me, I`d learned them earlier. 
I`ve just repetead:
- In Module_1, how to change to another directory; move, rename files and directories; list the contents of a directory;
print my current working directory; make a new directory; display the contents of a file.
- In Module_2, how to copy files; remove files; list the groups I am in; remove empty directories; change file permissions. Also I`ve learned
about representing all files '*', all other users 'o'; executive permission 'x'.

Module_3, Module_4 were new for me. 
I`ve learned:
- In Module_3, how to concatenate files; view manual pages; show print queue status; show where locate files; remove print jobs; show user information.
Also Also I`ve learned about such symbols as ~ means home directory; > sends output to a new file; . means current directory.
I hope to use this useful information in my future professional activity.
- In Module_4, commands show free disk space, process ststus, option aux, tells a process to die gracefully, option -9,
finds words in text. Also about symbol | and option -r.

Articles about HTTP protocol were really hard to clear understanding in details and I hope to sort out with all that info later. Although main 
understanding of HTTP Basics, Tools to View HTTP Traffic, Using HTTP in Web Frameworks and Libraries, HTTP connections, Identification and Authentication is present.

I hope to use this useful information in my future professional activity, especial Linux CLI, Web Developers Tools, Identification and Authentication.

In this third part of General level about Git Collabotation new for me were almost all information. I`ve learned:
  1. Working with remotes.
   - collaborate with others
   - use GitHub
   - contribute to a repo
   - develop on an active project
  2. Working on another developers repository.
   - forking a repository
   - reviewing another developers change
   - knowing what change to make
  3. Staying in sync with a remote repository.
   - create a pull request
   - retrieve and sync updates
   - develop on an active pull request
   - squash commits
